# blogz
<h2>Not your ordinary blog site</h2>
<p>
This is a site where guests can preview blog entries and people can sign up for a user account and create their own blogs. This is a project in progress and will be added to frequently to update functionality using an Agile development framework.

Instructions:
This project is built using a mysql database. The following dependencies are needed
<ol>
<li>mamp (mamp pro is not neccesary)</li>
<li>Python 3</li>  
<li>An IDE of your choice</li>
<li>Flask</li>
<li>Wifi connection</li>
<li>Create a username and password for access to the site</li>
<li>You now have access to a template blog site where users can create blogs. Input validation handles incorrect entries for username and password. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>  
    </p>

    Note <br> This is a work in progress for a website I believe will help more young people vote. Stay tuned
